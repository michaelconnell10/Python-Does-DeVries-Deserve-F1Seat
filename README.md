# Does DeVries Deserve an F1 Seat?

**** THIS PROJECT WAS COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF DE VRIES BEING OFFERED THE ALPHA TAURI SEAT FOR THE 2023 SEASON.

It was no secret that Alpha Tauri wanted Colton Herta to partner Yuki Tsunoda for the 2023 season. A move that financially makes sense. Formula 1 has
been getting increasingly popular year over year in America (in large part thanks to Netflix's Drive to Survive) and tapping into that American market
with an American driver financially makes sense for a team with a budget below the average of teams they are looking to compete with. Williams are looking 
to make the exact same move with Logan Sargeant. 

However, after the FIA ruled that they would not award Colton Herta a super licence, Alpha Tauri had to look elsewhere for their Pierre Gasly replacement.
The main name surrounding F1 journalism quickly became Nyck De Vries.

Alpha Tauri largely acts as a junior team to Red Bull. A team that they (Red Bull) bring in their rookies from F2, see if they adapt to the sport quickly,
and if they do - promote them to the top team when the time is right (or wrong in Gasly's case). That being said, the higher ups at Red Bull have been
incredibly vocal about their lack of faith in their current crop of academy drivers in F2. And after seeing the success that Williams have had looking
outside the Mercedes/Williams academy programs and bringing in an experienced driver in Alex Albon (a former Red Bull academy driver, funnily enough), 
it showed Alpha Tauri that in order to compete and fight to get back to the midfield, looking outside of the Red Bull academy may be the key to success.

But is Nyck de Vries worthy of a seat? A former F2 champion, winning in 2019, never got a seat in Formula 1 (thanks largely to "pay drivers"). Since 2019,
he has been competing in the Formula E championship for Mercedes - winning the 2020-21 World Championship and helping Mercedes win back-to-back constructors
championships in 2020-21 and 2021-22. Along with this, Nyck has also been acting as a Mercedes reserve driver.

Even with being the reserve driver of Mercedes, de Vries has been given an abnormally large amount of time in the car this season:
  Spain: FP1 appearance in place of Albon at Williams
  France: FP1 appearance in place of Hamilton at Mercedes
  Monza: FP1 appearance in place of Vettel at Aston Martin & replaced Albon at Williams for FP3, Qualifying, and Race after Albon developed appendicitis
  Mexico: FP1 appearance in place of Russell at Mercedes

Lets look into the data of each of these apperances and see if we can find out whether Red Bull have found their long-term replacement for Sergio Perez, or
if this is just "bandaging the cracks" until their rookies in F3 and available for a Super Licence and entry into Formula 1.
